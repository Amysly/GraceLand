This project is a school management web application designed to simplify and automate core school operations. It provides functionality for student registration, admission management, school fees payment, and administrative tasks, all in one platform.

The system is built to help schools manage student data efficiently while giving administrators full control over academic and financial processes. It is suitable for learning purposes, portfolio projects, and future expansion into a full production-ready system.
